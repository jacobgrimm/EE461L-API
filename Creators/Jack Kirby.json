    "description": "BackgroundYoung Jack Kirby with his parents circa 1920Jacob Kurtzberg was born in New York City, in a tenement house on Essex Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan on August 28, 1917. His parents, Benjamin and Rosemary Kurtzberg had migrated to America from Austria around the the turn of the century. The alleged reason for the Kurtzberg's migration was dramatic, if unconfirmable: the story was that Benjamin had insulted a member of German aristocracy and the German, who was an expert marksman, challenged him to a duel. To escape almost certain death, Benjamin decided to move to America with his wife. Whether this tale is factual or a bit of familial fancy told by the Elder Kurtzberg to his family remains a mystery, but the drama of the tale undoubtedly left an impression on young Jacob. Benjamin was a tailor by trade, and like many immigrants from the Old Country, he found work from the New York garment factories. He worked long hours, but the family had still trouble to make ends",
