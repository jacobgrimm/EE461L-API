    "description": "Personal LifeJames H. \u201cJim\u201d Williams III is the great-nephew of country music legend Hank Williams. He works as a comic book artist under the name J.H. Williams III. Williams started like many other artists by drawing popular Marvel and DC characters as a kid. He is a lifelong fan of Megos Micronauts toy line, and he recalls Micronauts #1 as a seminal comic in his life, and the first time he actually paid attention to a credits box. Williams maintains that he is an absolute sponge for art styles and graphic and narrative processes. Anything he sees or hears is fodder for study and eventually makes it back into his artwork, but he readily cites Jim Steranko, Will Eisner and Jim Starlin as heavy influences for his page layouts.CareerWilliams most noteworthy early work was the four-issue mini-series Deathwish. It was published from 1994 to 1995 by Milestone Media, written by Adam Blaustein and inked by Jimmy Palmiotti. In 1997, Williams came to prominence as the artist on the short-live",
