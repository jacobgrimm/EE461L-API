A call comes to Gordon from the police department, a man has been murdered and fingerprints on the knife shows that it was the mans son. Gordon heads over there immediately, accompanied by Wayne. When they arrive, the mans son explains that when he came home he found his father stabbed to death. He picked up the knife which is why his fingerprints were on it. While still at the crime scene, Commissioner Gordon receives a call from Steve Crane, one of the victims business partners who claims there has been an anonymous threat on his life.No sooner has Crane gotten off the phone with police than an armed assailant shoots him and steals a paper from his home climbing out the window to the roof with the help of a partner. The \"Bat-Man\" knocks one unconscious and tosses the other off the roof, and retrieves and reads the document before jumping into a car ",
