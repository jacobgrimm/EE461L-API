    "description": "New writer Fabian Nicieza shows how the New Mutants are being pulled in different directions. Rictor wants to save Rahne, Cable wants to raise troops for war, and the remaining members just want to be a family. But, with the death of Roberto's father and the appearance of an old acquaintance, the New Mutants look ready for some big changes.SynopsisIn his Colorado estate, Gideon prepares for the day with his morning's exercise. He breaks through some of the best programs Shaw Industries has to offer, then towels off while listening to the day's schedule. Regarding the DaCosta stock inquiry, Gideon makes sure that his operative, Eve, is in place and ready to proceed with their plan. Gideon is assured that all will go well.In the Danger Room, Cannonball infringes upon Cable's practice session with the excuse that he needs practice too. Cable uses the opportunity to see if Cannonball is able to concentrate enough in a battle situation to limit the noise of his combustion. Surprising Cannon",
