    "description": "George P\u00e9rez (born June 9, 1954) is a Puerto Rican illustrator and writer who, as an immigrant, grew up poor in the Bronx. Along with John Byrne, he was arguably the most popular and influential artist in American comic books in the 1980s. He primarily illustrates superhero comics, mainly published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, and is known for his clean, dynamic, yet ornate style, with a strong emphasis on group superhero action scenes, and distinctive rubble. He worked and created many characters alongside writer Marv Wolfman.During his run on Wonder Woman in the 1980s, in addition to the regular action of the series, he also chose to explore topics as background to the main series. These included the growing pains of a teenager, the bonds between women and the cost of celebrity.He can be seen as a character in occasional comics (New Teen Titans #s 20 &amp; 50).This life-long Fantastic Four fan considers George Perez to be one of the top three FF artists of all time, along with Bus",
