    "description": "A monumental Golden-Age writer and creator who was very VERY under-appreciated for his time! Although you may not know his name Bill Finger is one of the most influential creators in comic book history. Finger first began collaborating with DC comics and Bob Kane in 1938 on adventure strips.Then a Superhero that redefined comic books flew into the scene known as Superman (By Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster) and \"S\" embroidered hero became a surprise hit (see Action Comics #1). That is when Bill Finger and Bob Kane (along with most of the early comic book world) were busy attempting to duplicate the man of steel''s success. And although Bob Kane is often credited as the sole creator of Batman- he is not! Bill Finger contributed much of the early integral aspects of the Batman mythology, including much of the costume design (Kane was largely inspired by The Phantom) that got Batman''s look away from being too similar to the Phantom and Finger gave him the name Bruce Wayne.Comics historian Ron",
