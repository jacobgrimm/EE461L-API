Jerry Robinson was the president and is the founder of the Cartoonists and Writers Syndicate/Cartoon Arts International.",
    "description": "Legendary Golden Age artist who studied journalism at Columbia University in Manhattan.Jerry penciled and/or inked many of the early Batman (including issue 1) and Detective Comics covers during the 30''s and 40''. Jerry Robinson is the sole creator of the Joker (although this has been argued about at length). Many of the problems for Jerry''s proper recognition stem from Bob Kane who finagled many legalities about Batman and his cast of supporting characters and disputed Robinson being the sole creator of the Joker. Jerry Robinson did public appearances, interviews and open discussions about this til the day he died. If you have ever read or seen anything Batman related you may have noticed that somewhere it will read \"Batman Created by Bob Kane\" BUT... (and that is a big BUT!)... Bob Kane is NOT the sole creator of Batman and there is even a controversy that Kane didn''t even come up with Batman but instead came up with \"Birdman\" and Bill Finger was the one who suggested it be a \"Batman.",
