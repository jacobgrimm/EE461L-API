    "deck": "Sheldon Moldoff is a legendary comic book artist for DC comics.  Not the most polite guy to meet and not outgoing to fans.   Moldoff co-created Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Batwoman, Clayface (Matt Hagen) and the original Batgirl.",
    "description": "One of Bob Kane''s uncredited artists (aka \"Ghost Artist\") for years he went without getting any credit for his work in Batman and Detective comics. So all the artwork that Sheldon Moldoff did Bob Kane got credit for. It was decades before DC Comics acknowledged all his efforts. His career spans almost every first appearance of the most famous DC creations ever known. Sheldon drew the covers for the first appearances of both the Green Lantern (Alan Scott) in All-American Comics #16 and The Flash in Flash Comics #1. He also worked on Sensation Comics #1, which featured the origin story of Wonder Woman. And he did the artwork on the inside cover of Action Comics #1 featuring the first appearance of Superman. He has pencilled 146 issues of Detective Comics, 121 issues of Batman and 67 issues of Worlds Finest Comics. But this Golden Age phenomenon is known, to hardcore comic enthusiasts for his work on issues of both Hawkman and Hawkgirl in the Flash Comics series.Many fans would buy Batman",
