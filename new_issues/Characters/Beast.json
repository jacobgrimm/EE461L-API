    "description": "As usual the character is presented as a version of the classic fairy tale. It starts with the modern story of an abusive boyfriend who suspects his girlfriend of cheating on him with one of her co-workers. He is physically abusive to her and as she runs, Sela gives her a story to consider, that of Beauty and the Beast. It tells the story of a selfish prince that used the people around him and who treated the women in his life as expendable. Finally one girl arrives and curses him with showing the world his true appearance inside and which will be made permanent once all the flowers fall from a single rose flower if he cannot find someone to love him. He decides he must change his ways and he nurses back to health a young woman he finds in the woods, but once she informs him that she must return to her fiance, he grows enraged and forces her to stay as his captive. The action cuts back shortly to modern day where both her co-worker asks her out and then her boyfriend apologizes. As it ",
