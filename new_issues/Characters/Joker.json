    "description": "OriginThe exact origin of the Joker is unknown, and urban legends abound. According to some she''s a manifestation of all the souls of those who died during the Cuban Missile Crisis (on Earth Tangent the missile were lauched), others say that she''s a wacky space alien trapped on Earth.Apparently only her ally/enemy officier John Kell of the New Atlantis Police Department came close to the truth. Mary Marvel was born about 10 years after the Crisis, one of the few children that didn''t suffered from any kind of malformation from the radiation. She was considered a reason to smile in a grim world. Growing up she was acutely aware of the hypocrisy of the society she lived in, especially of the city of New Atlantis .As a student at New Atlantis University she came into contact with the journalist Lori Lemaris and the reclusive millionare Christy Xanadu. They banded together and created the heroic identity of the Joker, so that people wouldn''t forget the hypocrisy of the world.CreationThe Jok",
