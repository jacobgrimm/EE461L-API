    "description": "OriginAfter something happened to the original Captain America, the government sought a new replacement to undergo the Super-Soldier process. While experimented on, they discovered that their choice was actually a mutant and the process had unleashed and magnified his latent mutant powers exponentially. Upon discovering his powers over vast psionic energies and being unable to control them, the mutant was rendered mentally unstable. Afterwards, the government claimed the mutant \"Captain America-X\" was killed by his own uncontrollable powers yet instead he lived and was allowed to become the new Captain America regardless.Cap-X joined the Avengers and began a relationship with Black Widow, all the while keeping his mutant powers hidden from his teammates. During a battle, his powers began to trigger which made him flee in a bid to keep his secret. His fellow Avengers labelling him a coward, he was sharply ejected from the Avengers and Black Widow and Iron Man held a grudge ever since.Cr",
